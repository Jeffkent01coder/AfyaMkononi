# Afya Mkononi App

## Overview

Afya Mkononi is a mobile application aimed at providing users with convenient access to health-related information and services on their smartphones. The app, built using Kotlin for frontend development and XML for layout, incorporates a variety of features to enhance user experience. Firebase is utilized for authentication and backend services, while Retrofit handles networking tasks. Additionally, the app integrates machine learning algorithms to provide advanced functionalities such as symptom checking and personalized recommendations.

**New Feature: Real-Time Chat Component with Firebase Integration**

We're excited to introduce a real-time chat component that facilitates seamless communication between users and healthcare providers. This feature leverages Firebase for both real-time updates and authentication, ensuring secure and efficient communication. MongoDB, initially planned for chat data storage, was partially implemented but has been replaced with Firebase to optimize performance and scalability. A Node.js backend has been developed to manage the communication flow and enhance the reliability of the chat feature.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login functionality using Firebase authentication.
- **Health Information**: Access a vast array of health-related articles, tips, and information.
- **Symptom Checker**: Input symptoms and receive potential diagnoses or necessary actions using machine learning algorithms.
- **Appointment Booking**: Conveniently book appointments with healthcare providers within the app.
- **Reminder System**: Set reminders for medication, appointments, or other health-related tasks.
- **Community Forums**: Engage in discussions, ask questions, and share experiences in a supportive community environment.
- **Personal Health Records**: Safely store and manage personal health records.
- **Machine Image Recognition**: Utilize image scanning for instant results on processed images.
